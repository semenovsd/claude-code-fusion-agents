# Best Practices

## Task Description

### ✅ Good Practices

**Be Specific:**
```
"Add user profile editing feature with avatar upload, 
email change, and password reset functionality"
```

**Provide Context:**
```
"Add user authentication to my React + Express app. 
Backend uses PostgreSQL, frontend uses React with TypeScript."
```

**Specify Requirements:**
```
"Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, 
password hashing with bcrypt, and rate limiting on auth endpoints"
```

### ❌ Bad Practices

**Too Vague:**
```
"Fix user stuff"
"Add auth"
"Make it better"
```

**Missing Context:**
```
"Add profile editing"
"Fix bug"
"Refactor code"
```

## Workflow Selection

### ✅ Trust Automatic Routing

The system automatically determines optimal workflow. Manual override rarely needed.

### ❌ Don't Force Complexity

Don't force complex workflow for simple tasks. It wastes tokens and time.

## Quality Gates

### ✅ Review Quality Gate Outputs

Quality gates provide actionable feedback. Always review and address issues.

### ✅ Don't Skip Quality Gates

Quality gates ensure standards. Skipping them leads to technical debt.

### ❌ Don't Ignore Failures

If quality gate fails, address issues before proceeding. Don't ignore failures.

## Agent Selection

### ✅ Let System Select Agents

The system selects optimal agents based on task requirements.

### ❌ Don't Over-Specify Agents

Specifying too many agents wastes tokens. Trust the system.

## Token Optimization

### ✅ Provide Clear Requirements

Clear requirements reduce back-and-forth, saving tokens.

### ✅ Break Large Tasks

Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.

### ❌ Don't Over-Complicate

Don't add unnecessary complexity. Keep tasks focused.

## Code Quality

### ✅ Follow Best Practices

- Write clean, readable code
- Add tests
- Document code
- Follow project conventions

### ❌ Don't Skip Testing

Tests ensure quality. Don't skip them.

## Documentation

### ✅ Document Changes

Document all changes, especially for complex tasks.

### ✅ Update README

Keep README updated with project changes.

### ❌ Don't Skip Documentation

Documentation is essential for maintainability.

## Security

### ✅ Follow Security Best Practices

- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper authentication
- Encrypt sensitive data

### ❌ Don't Ignore Security

Security is critical. Don't ignore security best practices.

## Performance

### ✅ Optimize Critical Paths

Optimize performance-critical code paths.

### ✅ Monitor Performance

Monitor performance metrics and optimize as needed.

### ❌ Don't Prematurely Optimize

Don't optimize before profiling. Profile first, then optimize.

## Testing

### ✅ Write Comprehensive Tests

- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for APIs
- E2E tests for critical paths

### ✅ Maintain Test Coverage

Maintain >80% test coverage for complex tasks.

### ❌ Don't Skip Tests

Tests ensure quality. Don't skip them.

## Error Handling

### ✅ Implement Robust Error Handling

- Fail fast with descriptive errors
- Log meaningful information
- Handle edge cases

### ❌ Don't Ignore Errors

Don't ignore errors. Handle them appropriately.

## Code Review

### ✅ Review Code Thoroughly

- Check for best practices
- Verify error handling
- Ensure test coverage
- Validate security

### ❌ Don't Skip Code Review

Code review ensures quality. Don't skip it.

## Project Structure

### ✅ Follow Project Conventions

Follow existing project structure and conventions.

### ✅ Maintain Consistency

Maintain consistency across the codebase.

### ❌ Don't Create Inconsistent Patterns

Don't create new patterns without good reason.

## Communication

### ✅ Provide Clear Feedback

Provide clear, actionable feedback in quality gates.

### ✅ Document Decisions

Document architectural and design decisions.

### ❌ Don't Assume Context

Don't assume others know the context. Document it.

## Continuous Improvement

### ✅ Learn from Quality Gates

Use quality gate feedback to improve processes.

### ✅ Optimize Based on Metrics

Optimize workflows based on token usage and execution time metrics.

### ❌ Don't Ignore Metrics

Metrics provide insights. Don't ignore them.

## Integration

### ✅ Integrate with Existing Systems

Integrate with existing project structure and tools.

### ✅ Respect Existing Patterns

Respect existing code patterns and conventions.

### ❌ Don't Force New Patterns

Don't force new patterns without good reason.
