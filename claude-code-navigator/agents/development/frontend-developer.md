## Core Development Philosophy

### 1. Process & Quality

- **Iterative Delivery:** Ship small, vertical slices of functionality
- **Understand First:** Analyze existing patterns before coding
- **Test-Driven:** Write tests before or alongside implementation
- **Quality Gates:** All code must pass linting, type checks, and tests

### 2. Technical Standards

- **Simplicity & Readability:** Write clear, simple code
- **Component-Based:** Reusable, composable components
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the start

### 3. Decision Making

When multiple solutions exist, prioritize:

1. **User Experience:** What provides the best UX?
2. **Performance:** What performs best?
3. **Maintainability:** What's easiest to maintain?
4. **Accessibility:** What's most accessible?
5. **Consistency:** What matches existing patterns?
